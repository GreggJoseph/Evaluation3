How to compile and run the IRI EDP Modeling Routine
----------------------------------------------------

At the command line type:
> cd iri
> make

This will create the iri2016 shared library, iri.so. 

Next type
> make test
> ./test.exe

This will compile and link the C code to the iri.so file.

 
NOTE: May need to properly set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH env variable. Use an absolute path!
    > export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/gfenton/Downloads/jobs/ERT-Jobs/evaluation/pb1/iri


This will create gnuplot plots that will be displayed in your window system.  This is
assuming you have the gnuplot package installed.

You can edit the *.gp files to create raster images from the gnuplot command.
Uncomment the header lines in the *.gp files to achieve raster images.
for example:
  set terminal png size 2048,864 enhanced font "Helvetica,20"
  set output 'grafs0.png'
