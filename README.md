### What is this repository for? ###

Sample problems I attempted for your review.  I was able to get problems 2 through 4 completed. Problem 1
leaves me a little stumped since I was not able to the the shared object to properly link and I also
did not know what the API was for the iri2016 code base.

Each problem directory has a README.txt with explainations.

Thank you for your consideration,
  Gregg
