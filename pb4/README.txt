This file spatial-interpolation.Rmd can be run in the RStudio. The spatial-interpolation.Rmd
is a R markdown file.  R is well suited for this type of problem.  I use R routinely for
this type of problem.  Typically I use this for interpolating pressure time histories over a 
terrain. 

The spatial-interpolation.docx is a Word version of the R markdown.
